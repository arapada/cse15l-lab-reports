# Lab Report 3
## Researching Commands
`grep`

Option: `-rl`

Example 1:
```
$ grep -rl "base pair" technical/biomed/*.txt
  technical/biomed/1471-2091-3-4.txt
  technical/biomed/1471-2105-2-8.txt
  technical/biomed/1471-2105-2-9.txt
...
```
Example 2:
```
$ grep -rl "danger" technical/911report/*.txt
  technical/911report/chapter-1.txt
  technical/911report/chapter-10.txt
  technical/911report/chapter-11.txt
  technical/911report/chapter-12.txt
  technical/911report/chapter-13.1.txt
...
```

`$ grep -rl "string" <file/directory>` outputs lines of files that contain the inputted string. 
This command is useful because it can accurately shows different files that contain the specific key. This is way easier than finding specific words or a puzzle to solve.

  technical/government/About_LSC/CONFIG_STANDARDS.txt:clients; and client-community empowerment?

```
`$ grep -i "sTrInG" <file/directory>` outputs file and the lines that contain "sTrInG", ignoring case sensitivity. This is useful just incase you make any typos of any kind.

Option: `-Eo '\b\w+ing\b'`

Example 1:
```
$ grep -Eo '\b\w+ing\b' technical/government/Alcohol_Problems/*.txt
  technical/government/Alcohol_Problems/Session2-PDF.txt:drinking
  technical/government/Alcohol_Problems/Session2-PDF.txt:opening
  technical/government/Alcohol_Problems/Session2-PDF.txt:screening
  technical/government/Alcohol_Problems/Session2-PDF.txt:using
  technical/government/Alcohol_Problems/Session2-PDF.txt:screening
...
```

Example 2:
```
$ grep -Eo '\b\w+tion\b' technical/plos/*.txt
  technical/plos/pmed.0020232.txt:population
  technical/plos/pmed.0020232.txt:ingestion
  technical/plos/pmed.0020232.txt:colonization
...
```
`$ grep -Eo '\b\w+ing\b' <file/directory>` prints out the file and it's line containing the suffix "-ing". This is useful because it can help with getting a specific word in mind but forgot the rest of the word.

Option: `-A <number>`

Example 1:
```
$ grep -A 5 "DNA" technical/plos/*.txt
--
  technical/plos/pmed.0020237.txt:        possible interaction with host DNA binding proteins. The team found that a protein present
  technical/plos/pmed.0020237.txt-        in the human host—hnRNPK—could be isolated by direct binding to a viral fragment derived
  technical/plos/pmed.0020237.txt-        from the HBV variant of these infected patients.
  technical/plos/pmed.0020237.txt-        hnRNPK has previously been shown to be involved in several cellular functions—for

`$ grep -A <number> "string" <file/directory>` prints out the file and lines that contain "string" after a number of lines. This can be used to find context clues of a word or break down text files that include that string.

Source: From using `man grep` in terminal.

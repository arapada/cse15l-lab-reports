## Remotely Connecting
Connecting remotely to your course-specific account requires your terminal. You can access your terminal through VSCode or your built-in terminal on your device. 

To access your Terminal on VSCode, make sure to be on a new file (it can be any type of file) then click on Terminal -> New Terminal. This will pop out a new terminal that is shown to be connected to your User device.
